# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of the PyBer analysis is to study ride-sharing data (ride_data.csv and city_data.csv) which includes rides, drivers, and fares for three city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural.

## Results
### Total Rides
The urban rides account for over two-thirds of the total rides (2375) at 68.4% compared to 26.3% for suburban rides and 5.3% for rural rides. 
### Total Drivers
The urban drivers account for 80.9% of total drivers (2973) compared to 16.5% for suburban drivers and 2.6% for rural drivers.
### Total Fares
Total urban fares account for 62.7% of the total fares ($63,538.64) compared to 30.5% for total suburban fares and 6.8% for total rural fares.
### Average Fare Per Ride
The average rural fare per ride is the highest at $34.62 followed by the average suburban fare ($30.97) and average urban fare ($24.53).
### Average Fare Per Driver
The average rural fare per driver is the highest at $55.49 followed by the average suburban fare ($39.50) and average urban fare ($16.57).
### Weekly Fares Per City Type
The weekly urban fares collected result in the highest revenue for PyBer with weekly fares of approximately $2000 over the time period of January 1, 2019 and April 29, 2019. The weekly suburban fares over the same time period are approximately $1000/week compared to the weekly rural fares of approximately $250/week.

## Summary Addressing Disparities Among City Types
### Recommendation 1
The average fare for rural drivers is $55.49 and 1.4 times more expensive than the suburban fare and 3.3 times more expensive than the urban fare. I suggest the rural drivers try to accomodate more than one paying rider to reduce the cost of each rider.
### Recomendation 2
The number of rural rides is 5.3% of the total rides, but the average fare is high compared to the other city types.?? 
### Recommendation 3
